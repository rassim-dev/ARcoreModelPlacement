# FitKit
FitKit is a mobile application that allows users to view products from a sports store with AR.

Our application uses SceneView to download 3D models of sports equipment from the database in Firebase Storage and displays them in AR on the user's device. With Google's ARCore, users can also measure the free space in their rooms through their phone's camera before placing the equipment.

In the shoe section of the application, users can try sneakers through the cameras of their phones using Kivisense's shoe try-on API or use a shoe size recommendation system designed using OpenCV and NumPy algorithms to receive their recommended shoe size.
